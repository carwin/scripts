<h2>Random scripts by Carwin</h2>
<p>I write scripts to do various things, a lot of them I won't bother pushing 
up to github because I don't care if I lose them. Sometimes though, when I'm 
learning a new language it's handy to keep the first few things I wrote in it 
both for reference and so I can go back and fix them up when I learn more.</p>
